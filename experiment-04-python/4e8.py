#8.	Take two sets and apply various set operations on them :
S1 = {"Red","yellow", "orange", "blue"}
S2 = {"violet", "blue", "purple"}
print("Set S1: ", S1)
print("Set S2: ", S2)
print("Union of S1 and S2: ", S1.union(S2))
print("Intersection of S1 and S2: ", S1.intersection(S2))
print("Difference of S1 and S2 (S1 - S2): ", S1.difference(S2))
print("Difference of S1 and S2 (S2 - S1): ", S2.difference(S1))
